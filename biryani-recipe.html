                        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
                    <ul>
                       <li> 2 cups basmati rice </li>
                       <li> 500g chicken, cut into pieces </li>

                       <li> 2 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste </li>
                       <li> Whole spices: bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, cinnamon sticks </li>
                       <li> Biryani masala powder </li>
                       <li> Fresh coriander leaves and mint leaves for garnish </li>
                       <li> Salt to taste </li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="recipe-para">
                    
                        Step 1:<br><span id="para"> Prep the Rice
                    
                        Rinse 2 cups of basmati rice until the water runs clear.
                        Soak the rice in water for 30 minutes.
                        Cook the rice until it's 70% done. You want it slightly undercooked.
                        Drain the rice and set it aside.<br><br>
                    </span>
                        Step 2:<br><span id="para"> Marinate the Chicken

                        In a bowl, combine 1 cup of yogurt, biryani masala powder, half of the sliced onions, ginger-garlic paste, and salt.
                        Add 500g of chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated.
                        Allow the chicken to marinate for at least 30 minutes.<br><br>
                    </span>
                        Step 3:<br><span id="para"> Saut√© Aromatics

                        In a large, heavy-bottomed pan, heat 1/4 cup of cooking oil or ghee.
                        Saut√© the remaining sliced onions until golden brown.
                        Add whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, cardamom, and cinnamon sticks.
                        Stir in ginger-garlic paste and saut√© until the raw aroma diminishes.<br><br>
                    </span>
                        Step 4:<br><span id="para"> Cook the Chicken

                        Add the marinated chicken to the pan.
                        Cook until the chicken is browned, and the masala is well-cooked.
                        Introduce chopped tomatoes and cook until they are softened.<br><br>
                    </span>
                        Step 5:<br><span id="para"> Layering the Biryani

                        In a separate deep pan, create layers. Start with half of the partially cooked rice.
                        Follow with the cooked chicken mixture.
                        Top it with the remaining rice.<br><br>
                    </span>
                        Step 6:<br><span id="para"> Dum Cooking (Slow Cooking)

                        Cover the pan tightly with a lid.
                        Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes. This allows the biryani to steam, and the flavors meld together.<br><br>
                    </span>
                        Step 7:<br><span id="para"> Garnish and Serve

                        Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork.
                        Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and mint leaves.
                        Serve hot with raita or a side salad.<br><br><br>
                    </span>
